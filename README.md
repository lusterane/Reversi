# Reversi
A group project for my Computer Architecture class. Written in MIPS (assembly) language

## Thank you team!
Credit is due for my group members as this was a team effort to make this project work:
Matthew Brazzel
Jack Walsh
Michael Wilson

## How to play
We created the popular game of Reversi which works like so:
On an 8x8 board, two players take turns placing down their colored pieces. If in at anytime, a player is able to create a straight line that is
bounded by that player's color, the other players pieces are turned to that player's color. Maybe sounds complicated if you've never experienced the
game but try it out for yourself! You'll have a blast in no time

## Let's play!
1. Execute Mars4_5-mod.jar file. This will be the IDE that will compile and run the assembly source code (NOTE MADE BY ME!)
2. Once in the IDE navigate to File -> Open and then find the mainR4.asm file
3. Have fun!

### I am still learning
Any feedback, whether it is about my GitHub management or this particular project, is very much appreciated. This was my first assembly project and I a fairly fresh user on GitHub.
Anyways, thank you for stopping by, bye!
